# Autocomplete

A component that provides suggestions to the user as they
type.

## When to use

- Large set of possible values: Autocomplete can help reduce
the number of options that users need to sift through, making it easier for them
to find what they're looking for.

- Enforcing Consistency: Autocomplete can enforce consistency
by presenting only valid options to the user, helping to prevent spelling errors
or other mistakes.

- Saving time: Autocomplete can save users time by reducing
the amount of typing they need to do and by providing suggestions that are
relevant to what they're looking for.

- Complex data entry: Autocomplete can be useful for complex data entry,
such as entering addresses or product names, where a pre-defined list
of options can simplify the process for the user.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.Basic} />

### Multiple

Set `multiple` to `true` to allow multiple values. User will see tags
with values that were selected.

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.Multiple} />

### Invalid

Set `invalid` to `true` to indicate an error or an issue with the
input value. If value is `thue`, then a clear error feedback should be provided
using ErrorMessage component.

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.Invalid} />

### Sizes

Use `size` property to specify the size of input box. Available values: `sm`,
`md`, `lg`.

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.Sizes} />

### Rounded

Set `rounded` to `true` to use input box with rounded corners.

<Canvas of={AutocompleteStories.Rounded} />

## Guidelines

- When no suggestions are available because of an error, provide clear error
feedback using `loadingError` property.

- Use Label component for providing a label that accurately describes
the purpose of the input. Label component should be associated
with the Autocomplete component using the "htmlFor" and "id" properties.

- Use ErrorMessage component for providing error feedback to indicate
that the input value is invalid or required.

- Provide placeholder text that contains a brief description of what the input
field is for and what type of information is expected using `placeholder`
property.

- If necessary, add help text that provides additional information or guidance
using InputMessage component.

- Use localized values for text that is accessible for the user or screen
readers. Use these properties to provide custom labels: `clearLabel`,
`loadingLabel`, and `noResultLabel`.

## Accessibility

Autocomplete is implemented as part of a [combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox)
defined in WAI ARIA Practices.
