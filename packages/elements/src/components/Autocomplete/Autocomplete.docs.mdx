# Autocomplete

Autocomplete is a web component that provides suggestions for completing a
user's input based on a pre-defined list of options. It is often implemented as
part of a [combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox),
in which a text input field is paired with a dropdown menu of suggestions. This
pattern is defined by the W3C as a "combination of a drop-down list and an
editable text box," allowing for both free-form input and pre-defined options.
