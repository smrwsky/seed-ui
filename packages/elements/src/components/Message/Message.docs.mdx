# Message

A compact and non-intrusive user interface element used to display brief messages or notifications to the user. This
type of toast component is designed to provide concise updates, alerts, or information to the user without requiring any
action or interaction.

## When to use

- Quick Feedback: Providing immediate feedback to user actions or interactions, such as confirming the successful
completion of a drag-and-drop operation or notifying the user when a file upload is complete.

- Real-time Updates: Showing real-time updates or events, such as displaying a small toast message to inform the user
when new chat messages arrive or when a user joins or leaves a live discussion.

- Progress or Loading Indicators: Using a small toast message to indicate the progress of a long-running operation,
such as a file download or data processing, without obstructing the user's view or taking up too much screen space.

- Status Updates: Showing status updates or changes in the application state, such as notifying the user when
a background task is complete or when a process has finished syncing.

- Quick Tips or Reminders: Providing quick tips, reminders, or helpful hints to guide the user through the application
or highlight important features. For instance, displaying small toast messages to offer keyboard shortcuts or suggest
best practices.

## Guidelines

- Keep it Concise: Limit the content of the toast message to be short and to the point. Use clear and concise language
to convey the message or notification effectively.

- Important and Time-sensitive Information: Reserve the use of small toast messages for conveying important and
time-sensitive information that users need to be aware of. Avoid using them for trivial or non-essential updates.

- Appropriate Duration: Set an appropriate duration for the toast message to stay visible on the screen. Ensure it is
long enough for users to read and understand the content, but not so long that it becomes a distraction or annoyance.

- Avoid Overuse: Use small toast messages judiciously and avoid overloading the user with frequent or excessive
notifications. Only display relevant and significant information that adds value to the user experience.

- User Feedback and Iteration: Gather user feedback on the usage of message components and iterate based on user
responses. Continuously evaluate their effectiveness in conveying information and refine the implementation as needed.

## Accessibility

- By default, Message component is rendered with 'alert' role. It means that the information inside the toast is
important and time-sensitive. The 'status' role also can be used for non-critical updates that don't require immediate
attention.
