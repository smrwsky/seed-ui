# Text

A Text React component is a reusable element in a React application designed specifically for implementing various
typography styles, such as headings, body text, labels, and captions. It allows developers to easily apply consistent
and customizable text formatting across their app, enhancing design and readability while maintaining code modularity.

## When to use

- Headings: Apply different levels of headings (e.g., h1, h2, h3) with appropriate font sizes and styles for titles
and sections.

- Body Text: Style regular paragraphs and content text to ensure uniformity in font size, line height, and spacing.

- Labels: Create visually appealing and consistent labels for form elements, input fields, and other UI components.

- Links: Style hyperlink text for navigation and user interaction, including hover and active states.

- Captions: Add captions to images, charts, or media elements with consistent typography for enhanced accessibility.

- Responsive Typography: Use responsive properties for font size and margins to ensure text scales appropriately across
screen sizes.

## Examples

### Basic

### Headings

Headings are used to create a hierarchy of titles and sections within a page. They are used to organize content and
guide users through the page.

<Canvas of={Headings} />

### Body

Body text is used for regular paragraphs and content text. It is used to provide additional information and context to
users.

<Canvas of={Body} />

### Labels

Labels are used to identify form elements, input fields, and other UI components. They are used to provide additional
information and context to users.

## Guidelines

- Font Selection: Choose fonts that align with the app's branding and readability requirements. Consider using web-safe
fonts or loading custom fonts using web font services like Google Fonts.

- Hierarchy: Establish a clear typographic hierarchy with distinct styles for headings, subheadings, body text,
and other elements.

- Responsive Design: Ensure that typography adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations. Use responsive
properties to adjust font sizes and spacing as needed for various devices.

- Line Length: Limit line length to improve readability. Ideally, aim for 50-75 characters per line for body text.

- Line Height: Use a line height of 1.5-1.75 for body text to improve readability. For headings, use a line height of
1.25-1.5.

- Text Color: Use a limited color palette for text to maintain a cohesive design. Reserve unique or attention-grabbing
colors for specific elements like headings or call-to-action buttons.

- Whitespace: Embrace whitespace to improve text legibility and visual clarity. Proper margins and padding around text
elements create a cleaner design.

- Kerning and Letter Spacing: Adjust letter spacing (kerning) and word spacing as needed for improved typography,
especially for display or decorative text.

- Font Weight and Style: Use font weight and style variations (e.g., bold, italic) purposefully to emphasize key content
or create visual contrast.

- Localization: Design text elements to accommodate different languages, character sets, and text expansion
or contraction. Avoid hardcoded text lengths.

- Readability: Prioritize readability over aesthetics. Fancy fonts or decorative typography should not sacrifice ease
of reading.

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., h1, h2, p) for better accessibility and SEO.

- Ensure sufficient contrast between text, and it's background to meet accessibility standards. High contrast
aids readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
