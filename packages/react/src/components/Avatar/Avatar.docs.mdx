## Guidelines

- Consistency: Maintain a consistent style for avatars throughout your application to establish a cohesive visual
identity.

- Size Variants: Provide different size variants of avatars for various screen layouts and devices to ensure they
remain visually appealing.

- Performance: Optimize image files to reduce loading times, especially for larger avatars, and consider lazy loading
techniques for avatars that appear below the fold.

- Fallbacks: Have a fallback plan in case the avatar image fails to load, showing initials, icons, or a default image.

- Initials: When using initials as avatars, ensure they are generated consistently based on user names and use
contrasting colors for better readability.

- Retina Displays: Provide higher resolution avatar images for retina displays to maintain image quality.

- Performance Testing: Test avatars on various devices and connection speeds to ensure they load quickly and don't
impact overall performance.

- Mobile Considerations: Ensure avatars are appropriately sized and spaced for mobile interfaces to prevent
overcrowding.

- Localization: If your application supports multiple languages, make sure avatars adapt to different character sets
and text directions.

- API Integration: If avatars are fetched from external sources, handle errors and loading states gracefully to prevent
broken UI elements.

## Accessibility

Provide a descriptive `alt` attribute for avatar images to ensure they are accessible to screen readers and other
assistive technologies.
