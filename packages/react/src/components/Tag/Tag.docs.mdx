interface.

  categories. Users can click on tags representing different attributes, characteristics, or topics to filter and view
  content that matches those tags.

  interests, or expertise. Users can add tags to their profiles to showcase their areas of expertise, hobbies, or
  professional skills. his helps in creating a more detailed and personalized user profile.

  specific topics, categories, or keywords. This helps in organizing content and making it easier for users to find
  content that matches their interests.

## Guidelines

- Ensure that colors provided in `color`, `borderColor`, and `bg` props have sufficient contrast ratio.

- When `onClick` or `removable` prop is provided, the role is automatically set to `button` and `tabindex` is set to
  `0`. So you don't need to provide these props manually if there is no other use case.
