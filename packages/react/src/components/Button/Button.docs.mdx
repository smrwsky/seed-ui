# Button

A clickable element designed for user interaction, facilitating actions such as form submissions, navigation, or other
user-triggered events within the application's interface.


## When to use

- Form submission: Use the button component to create a "Submit" button within forms, allowing users to submit input
  data.

- Call-to-Action (CTA): Use the button component to create a CTA button, which is a button that prompts users to take a
  specific action.

- Navigation: Utilize the button for navigation purposes, linking to different sections or pages within the application,
  providing a clear and interactive user interface.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` prop to disable the button, preventing user interaction.

<Canvas of={Disabled} />

### Loading

Use `loading` prop to indicate that the button is in a loading state.

<Canvas of={Loading} />

### Sizes

Use `size` prop to change the size of the button.

<Canvas of={Sizes} />

### Variants

Use `variant` prop to change the variant of the button.

<Canvas of={Variants} />

### With Icon

Use `startIcon` and `endIcon` props to add icons to the button.

<Canvas of={WithIcon} />

### Rounded

Use `rounded` prop to change the shape of the button.

<Canvas of={Rounded} />

### As Link

Use `as` prop to set custom element type.

<Canvas of={AsLink} />

## Guidelines

- Use `loading` prop to indicate that the button is in a loading state. It will disable the button and show a spinner
  inside it.

- Use Icon component to add icons to the button.


## Accessibility

- Provide a meaningful text for the button, which describes the action that will be performed when the button is
  clicked.

- If `as` prop is set to `a`, ensure having all required attributes for an anchor element (`href`, `rel`, `target`).

- If `as` prop is set to a non-interactive element, do not use any interactive props (`onClick`, `disabled`, `href`).
