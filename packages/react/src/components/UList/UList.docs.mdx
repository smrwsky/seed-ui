# UList

The UList component is used to create unordered lists. It is a wrapper for the `<ul>` element.

## When to use

- Bulleted Lists: Present lists of items with simple bullet points to convey information in an easy-to-read format.

- Icon Lists: Combine icons or symbols with list items to create visually appealing lists, such as a list of social
media icons and links.

- Checklists: Create checklists for tasks, to-do lists, or shopping lists, allowing users to mark items as completed.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Types

Use the `type` prop to change the list style.

<Canvas of={Types} />

### With Icons

Use Marker component to add icons to list items.

<Canvas of={WithIcons} />

## Guidelines

- List Item Content: Use ListItem component to wrap  list item content in `<li>` element. Each list item should contain
a single item of content or a group of related content.

- List Length: Keep unordered lists to a reasonable length. If a list becomes too long, consider breaking it into smaller
sub-lists or sections for improved comprehension.

- Nesting: You can nest ordered lists within other unordered lists or within unordered lists. This is useful
for representing hierarchies or sub-steps.

## Accessibility

- Semantic Structure: Use unordered lists when the order of items is not semantically meaningful, and the items can be
presented in any order.

- Use List Elements: Wrap each list item in `<li>` (list item) elements. Never use list-style markers (e.g., numbers,
letters) manually without the proper list structure.

- Descriptive Labels: Provide a clear and descriptive label or title for the unordered list using the `<caption>`
element or ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby. This label should
convey the purpose or context of the list.

- List Item Labels: Make sure list items have meaningful and concise labels. Avoid using generic labels like "item"
or "element." The labels should give users a clear understanding of the content.
