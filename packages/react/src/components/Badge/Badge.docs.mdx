# Badge

Badges are used to display counts, labels, or statuses for items in a user interface.

## When to use

- Notification Counts: Displaying the count of unread notifications or alerts. For example, indicating the number of new
messages or pending tasks.

- Status Indicators: Using a colored dot to indicate the status of an item, user, or process. For instance,
online/offline status of users.

- Badges on Icons: Overlaying badges on icons to show additional information. Common in navigation menus or product
icons.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Background Color

Set `beckgroundColor` to change the background color of the badge. This property accepts color tokens from the theme.

<Canvas of={BackgroundColor} />

### Dot

Set `dot` as `true` to show a dot without number.

<Canvas of={Dot} />

### Overflow Count

`overflowCount` is displayed when count is larger than overflowCount. The default value of overflowCount is 99.

<Canvas of={OverflowCount} />

### Zero Count

Set `showZero` as `true` to show a zero when count is zero. The default value of showZero is false.

<Canvas of={ZeroCount} />

### Position

Set `position` to change the position of the badge. The default value of position is `top-right`.

<Canvas of={Position} />

### Offset

Use `offsetX` and `offsetY` to set the offset of the badge.

<Canvas of={Offset} />

### Custom Content

You can use a custom component as the content of the badge.

<Canvas of={CustomContent} />

### Standalone

You can use a badge without children.

<Canvas of={Standalone} />

## Guidelines

- Use Color Meaningfully: Choose colors that align with your UI's color scheme and have appropriate meaning.
For example, red for alerts or green for success.

- Positioning: Position badges logically to indicate relevance. Top-right corners are often used, but consider the
context and user flow.

## Accessibility

Ensure badges are accessible to all users. Use proper contrast ratios and provide a meaningful title attribute
for tooltips.
