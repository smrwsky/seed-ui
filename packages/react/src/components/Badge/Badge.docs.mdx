## Guidelines

- Purposeful Use: Use Badge components to convey important information or interactions. Avoid using badges excessively,
as they can clutter the UI.

- Clear Meaning: Ensure the badge's purpose is clear to users. It should provide meaningful context and not confuse
users.

- Prioritize Content: Keep the badge content concise and relevant. If using a number, make sure it's essential to the
user's understanding.

- Use Color Meaningfully: Choose colors that align with your UI's color scheme and have appropriate meaning.
For example, red for alerts or green for success.

- Positioning: Position badges logically to indicate relevance. Top-right corners are often used, but consider the
context and user flow.

- Use as Supplement: Use badges as a supplementary element, not as a primary means of conveying crucial information.

- Avoid Redundancy: Don't use badges to repeat information that's already visible. They should provide additional
context or interactions.

- Contextual Use: Employ badges where they naturally fit in the context. Don't force them into places where they
don't make sense.

## Accessibility

Ensure badges are accessible to all users. Use proper contrast ratios and provide a meaningful title attribute
for tooltips.
