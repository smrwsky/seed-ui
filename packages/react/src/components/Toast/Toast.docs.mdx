# Toast

A small, non-intrusive notification in a user interface that includes a close button for the user to dismiss or hide
the notification.

## When to use

The Toast component is suitable for situations where you want to deliver concise information or notifications that users
can easily dismiss when they have read or acknowledged the message. It offers a non-disruptive way to provide updates
and feedback while allowing users to continue their tasks without significant interruption.

Here are some examples of situations where a toast component with a close button can be useful:

- Confirmation and Feedback: Use a toast component with a close button to provide confirmation or feedback to the user
  after completing an action or process.

- Error or Warning Messages: Display error or warning messages in a toast component with a close button to communicate
  issues or alerts to the user, allowing them to acknowledge and dismiss the notification.

- Information or Updates: When there is important information or updates that users need to be aware of, such as system
  maintenance or new features, use a toast component with a close button to briefly display the notification and allow
  users to close it after reading.

- Privacy or Consent Messages: Utilize a toast component with a close button to present privacy or cookie consent
  messages in compliance with regulations. Users can choose to close the toast if they don't wish to provide consent.

## Guidelines

- Keep it concise: Toast notifications should provide brief and concise information to the user. Avoid overwhelming
  them with excessive text or unnecessary details. Stick to the essential message that needs to be conveyed.

- Use appropriate variants: Choose the appropriate variant for the toast based on the nature of the message.
  For example, use "danger" for critical errors, "warning" for alerts, "success" for confirmations, "info" for general
  information, and "light" for neutral messages.

- Set a reasonable auto-close timeout: If you choose to include an auto-close feature, ensure that the timeout duration
  is reasonable. It should be long enough for users to read the notification but short enough to avoid causing frustration
  or blocking important content.

- Avoid stacking or overlapping: Ensure that toast notifications do not stack or overlap on the screen. If a new toast
  notification appears while one is already visible, it should replace or dismiss the existing one, preventing visual
  clutter.

- Test and iterate: Regularly test the toast component in different scenarios and gather feedback from users. Iterate
  and refine the design based on user feedback and observed behavior to improve its effectiveness and usability.

- Focus Management: Ensure that keyboard focus is managed appropriately when the toast is displayed. Set the focus to the toast when it
  appears and return the focus to the appropriate element once the toast is dismissed. This ensures keyboard users can
  perceive and interact with the toast notification.

## Accessibility

- By default, Toast component is rendered with 'alert' role. It means that the information inside the toast is important
  and time-sensitive. The 'status' role also can be used for non-critical updates that don't require immediate attention.

- The toast can be dismissed by pressing the "Esc" key.
