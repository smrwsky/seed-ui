# OList

The OList component is used to create ordered lists. It is a wrapper for the `<ol>` element.

## When to use

- Step-by-Step Instructions: Ordered lists are often used to present a sequence of steps or instructions, such
as cooking recipes or DIY tutorials.

- Procedural Documentation: Technical documentation and user manuals frequently use ordered lists to outline procedures,
ensuring users follow a specific sequence of actions.

- Tutorials and Guides: Educational content, tutorials, and guides often employ ordered lists to structure information
in a logical order.

- Table of Contents: In longer documents or books, ordered lists are used to create a table of contents, providing
an organized overview of the content's structure.

- Legal Documents: Legal documents, contracts, and agreements may use ordered lists to outline clauses, terms,
or articles.

- Reference Lists: Create reference lists, citation lists, or bibliographies that require a specific ordering of sources
or references.

- Timelines: Display chronological events or historical timelines using ordered lists with numeric or date-based labels.

- Survey Questions: In questionnaires and surveys, ordered lists can be used to present questions in a structured order.

- Ordered Rankings: Display ranked items, such as top 10 lists, leaderboards, or priority lists, with numeric labels.

- Sequential Data: When presenting sequential data, like numbered sections of a document, ordered lists ensure
a consistent numbering scheme.

- Mathematical Sequences: Ordered lists are used to represent mathematical sequences or series, indicating the order
of terms.

## Guidelines

- List Item Content: Use ListItem component to wrap  list item content in `<li>` element. Each list item should contain
a single item of content or a group of related content.

- Appropriate Numbering: Choose the appropriate numbering style for your list, such as decimal (1, 2, 3),
alphabetical (a, b, c), or Roman numerals (I, II, III), depending on the content and context.

- List Length: Keep ordered lists to a reasonable length. If a list becomes too long, consider breaking it into smaller
sub-lists or sections for improved comprehension.

- Nesting: You can nest ordered lists within other ordered lists or within unordered lists. This is useful
for representing hierarchies or sub-steps.

## Accessibility

- Semantic Structure: Use ordered lists when the sequence or order of items is semantically meaningful. Don't use
ordered lists for content that doesn't require a specific sequence.

- Use List Elements: Wrap each list item in `<li>` (list item) elements. Never use list-style markers (e.g., numbers,
letters) manually without the proper list structure.

- Descriptive Labels: Provide a clear and descriptive label or title for the ordered list using the `<caption>` element
or ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby. This label should convey
the purpose or context of the list.

- List Item Labels: Make sure list items have meaningful and concise labels. Avoid using generic labels like "item"
or "element." The labels should give users a clear understanding of the content.
