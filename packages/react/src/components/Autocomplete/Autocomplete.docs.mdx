# Autocomplete

A component that provides suggestions to the user as they
type.

## When to use

- Large set of possible values: Autocomplete can help reduce
the number of options that users need to sift through, making it easier for them
to find what they're looking for.

- Enforcing Consistency: Autocomplete can enforce consistency
by presenting only valid options to the user, helping to prevent spelling errors
or other mistakes.

- Saving time: Autocomplete can save users time by reducing
the amount of typing they need to do and by providing suggestions that are
relevant to what they're looking for.

- Complex data entry: Autocomplete can be useful for complex data entry,
such as entering addresses or product names, where a pre-defined list
of options can simplify the process for the user.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Multiple

The `multiple` property allows multiple values to be selected. Users will see tags displaying the selected values.

<Canvas of={Multiple} />

### Invalid

Setting the `invalid` property to `true` indicates an error or issue with the input value. When the value is set
to `true`, clear error feedback should be provided using the ErrorMessage component.

<Canvas of={Invalid} />

### Sizes

The `size` property can be used to specify the size of the input box. Available values are `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.

<Canvas of={Sizes} />

### Rounded

The `rounded` property can be set to `true` to use an input box with rounded corners.

<Canvas of={Rounded} />

### Allow Input Value

The `allowInputValue` property allows using the input value as the primary value and triggers the `onChange` callback
when the input value changes.

<Canvas of={AllowInputValue} />

### Auto Highlight

The `autoHighlight` property automatically highlights the first option in the dropdown list.

### Inline Auto Complete

The `inlineAutoComplete` property enables inline auto-completion, where the matched portion of the option is highlighted
in the input as the user types.

<Canvas of={InlineAutoComplete} />

## Guidelines

- When no suggestions are available because of an error, provide clear error
feedback using `loadingError` property.

- Use Label component for providing a label that accurately describes
the purpose of the input. Label component should be associated
with the Autocomplete component using the "htmlFor" and "id" properties.

- Use ErrorMessage component for providing error feedback to indicate
that the input value is invalid or required.

- Provide placeholder text that contains a brief description of what the input
field is for and what type of information is expected using `placeholder`
property.

- If necessary, add help text that provides additional information or guidance
using InputMessage component.

- Use localized values for text that is accessible for the user or screen
readers. Use these properties to provide custom labels: `clearLabel`,
`loadingLabel`, and `noResultLabel`.

## Accessibility

Autocomplete is implemented as part of a [combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox)
defined in WAI ARIA Practices.
