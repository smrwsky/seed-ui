# Marker

Marker component is used for customizing the marker of a list item.

## When to use

- Styled Bullet Points: Customize bullet points or markers for unordered lists (ul) to match the theme or branding
of your website or app.

- Checklists: Replace standard list markers with custom checkboxes or icons for to-do lists or task lists, providing
a more visually engaging way for users to track completion.

- Icons and Symbols: Use custom icons or symbols as markers to represent specific list items, such as using a star icon
to highlight important items in a list.

- Multilevel Lists: Customize markers to indicate hierarchical levels within multilevel lists, helping users understand
the list's structure.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

## Guidelines

- Marker component can be used only within ListItem component and UList component with `listStyle` set to `none`.

- Use Icon component or custom image as a child of Marker component to specify the marker.

## Accessibility

- Use `aria-label` to specify the marker for screen readers or use role 'presentation' to indicate that the element
is decorative and does not have any semantic value.

- If the marker contains image, provide appropriate alternative text (alt attributes)
to describe the content to users who cannot see it.

- If the icon inside marker is used as image, use `role` attribute to specify the type of image and provide
appropriate alternative text (alt attributes) to describe the content to users who cannot see it.

- If the marker content is interactive, use `role` attribute to specify the type of interactive element.
