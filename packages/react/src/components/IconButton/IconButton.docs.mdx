## Guidelines

- Clarity and Recognizability: Choose icons that are clear and easily recognizable, ensuring users understand the action
associated with the icon.

- Consistency: Maintain consistency in iconography throughout your application to create a unified and intuitive user
experience.

- Tooltip Usage: Provide tooltips or labels on hover (or for touch) to offer additional context for users who might not
be familiar with the icon's meaning.

- Limited Usage: Avoid overloading screens with too many icons, as it can lead to visual clutter and confusion.

- Appropriate Context: Ensure the actions triggered by the IconButton align with the surrounding context and user
expectations.

- Icon Placement: Place icons where users naturally expect them within the user interface, adhering to established
design patterns.

- Frequent Actions: Reserve IconButton usage for actions that users frequently perform to keep the interface clean
and focused.

- Testing and Feedback: Test icon placements and interactions with real users to gather feedback and optimize the user
experience.

## Accessibility

Use proper semantic markup and ARIA roles for screen readers, ensuring icons are accessible to users with disabilities.
